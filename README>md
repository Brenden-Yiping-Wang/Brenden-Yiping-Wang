## Introduction

The TimeTravelHub is a space for time travel aficionados to collaborate and explore the possibilities of traversing through time. Here, we gather scientific theories, hypothetical scenarios, simulation projects, and even prototype designs for potential time machines. Our goal is to foster a passionate community, where we can learn from each other and explore the intricacies of time travel together.

## Time Travel Theories

In this section, we delve into various time travel theories, from the well-known to the obscure. Discover the works of Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and others who have made significant contributions to the field of time travel.

- [General Relativity and Time Travel](theories/general_relativity.md)
- [Quantum Mechanics and Time Travel](theories/quantum_mechanics.md)
- [Wormholes and Time Loops](theories/wormholes_time_loops.md)
- [Multiverse Theory](theories/multiverse_theory.md)

## Simulation Projects

Put time travel theories to the test! Here, we provide various simulation projects that demonstrate time dilation, closed time-like curves, and more.
